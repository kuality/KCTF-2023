I was about to read this post, but then I saw Daesanghyuk. Now, I have to worship... Even though I know I'll be wide awake once I start worshiping, I must worship. It is the calling of one devoted to Daesanghyuk. Alright, I'll begin the worship

Sorry I dragged you to show this .. Naruto Sasuke Fight Level really Is it true? It's a fight between the world's strongest. Is that Naruto like that? The real Naruto is a legend..Naruto became a strongest legendary hero in the world since he became a king, and he became a king, and he was thrilled. And .. In the theater version, Sasuke suddenly appeared in front of Kakashi in front of Kakashi and smashed it up and crushed it. I'm so impressed and I recently learned about Boruto. I'm sorry. I'm looking at the 20th episode now, but the real Naruto generation is so thrilling and everyone is so big that I have to say it's an unknown memory. Shino seems to be talking a lot. It's a good teacher .. And why is he bored? Boruto is cute, but he looks like Naruto. It's true that his character resembles. And if you hit the internet, is this a real fact ?? The enemy is a new monster in Boruto? Look at Naruto Sasuke's coalition. It's really coming out .. If it is real, it's a must see. It doesn't destroy the real world .. Wow, it was really tearing that Naruto Sasuke is going to be like that. Ha .. I really want to see Sasuke .. When did it really become the newest strongest? I think in the past, I think when I'm in the middle, something sad, good, emotional, and various emotions are complicated.
